            <h1>EasyConnect Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

            <h3>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit website or app?</h3>

            <p>The application will collect usernames and passwords that you specify for the RDP, SSH, and VNC servers that you wish to connect to.</p>

            <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

            <p>The saved usernames and passwords will be transmitted to the servers that you connect to during the process of establishing the connection and/or authenticating you to the server.</p>

            <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>

            <p>The usernames and passwords are stored locally on your computer and are never sent externally except to the server that you are trying to connect to during the connection/authentication process.  The passwords are encrypted either through an RSA key that is generated during the setup process and stored in your user account's certificate store or through a Rijndael key that is derived from a password that you enter each time that you start the app.  This RSA or Rijndael key is kept local to your machine and is never transmitted remotely.  You are free to inspect the source code for the application, which is at <a href="https://github.com/lstratman/EasyConnect">https://github.com/lstratman/EasyConnect</a>.</p>

            <h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>

            <p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>

            <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>

            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your 'Personally Identifiable Information'.</p>

            <h3>Third-party links</h3>

            <p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website or in our app.</p>
