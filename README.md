This is a Windows tabbed remote desktop application whose UI was designed to resemble Chrome's.  Currently it supports Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), but will soon have a plugin architecture designed to enable third-party support for other protocols such as VNC, Citrix, etc.

For those of you building the application from source, you'll also need to get the source for my .NET Titlebar Tabs library, located at https://github.com/lstratman/.NETTitleBarTabs.
